## Session summary

- Task: Replace static `TOOL_REGISTRY_JSON` tool registry with runtime discovery of active n8n webhook nodes.
- Branch: master (changes applied directly in workspace)
- Date: 2025-09-25

## What I changed

- Added: `proxy_server/n8n_discovery.py` — a discovery helper that queries `GET /api/v1/workflows`, filters active workflows, extracts webhook nodes and builds a mapping of many key variants (node name, lowercased, last-segment, `functions.*`, workflow tokens, path tokens) to runtime webhook URLs and required headers.
- Updated: `proxy_server/tool_handler.py` — integrates `N8nDiscovery`, tries static registry overrides first, falls back to discovery (with TTL cache), and on 404 attempts a discovery.refresh() followed by one retry.
- Updated: `docker-compose.yml` — ensured `github-models-proxy` service receives `N8N_API_KEY` and `N8N_BASE_URL` from the environment so discovery can authenticate to n8n.
- Updated: `.env` — `TOOL_REGISTRY_JSON` removed by user instruction so discovery is the primary source.

## Current status

- Discovery implementation and integration are in place. The discovery module now exposes async `refresh()` and `get()` methods and caches mappings with `DISCOVERY_TTL`.
- The proxy can authenticate to n8n when `N8N_API_KEY` is provided in the container environment (verified via curl inside the container).
- Mapping generation was expanded to include many name variants to match upstream tool call names such as `functions.echo` and `echo`.

## Blocking issue (most recent)

- Resolved: an earlier indentation bug caused `N8nDiscovery.get` to be nested and not visible; I fixed it and re-checked for syntax errors.
- Current active blocker: run-time integration verification (end-to-end) still needs a successful final run in your environment to confirm `functions.*` names resolve and POSTs to webhook endpoints succeed. I could not run Docker compose here — I edited files and validated static checks only.

## Reproduction steps (how to validate locally)

1. Ensure `.env` includes the `N8N_API_KEY` and optionally `N8N_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://n8n:5678`).
2. Recreate proxy container to pick up changes:

```pwsh
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate github-models-proxy
```

3. From inside the `github-models-proxy` container, verify discovery can reach n8n with the API key:

```pwsh
# inside the container shell
curl -I -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: $env:N8N_API_KEY" "$env:N8N_BASE_URL/api/v1/workflows"
```

4. Run the test client to exercise tool calls that should be resolved by discovery:

```pwsh
python .\scripts\post_with_tools.py
```

5. Inspect logs for discovery events and tool call results:

```pwsh
docker compose logs github-models-proxy --tail 200
```

Look for these structured log events: `n8n.discovery.start`, `n8n.discovery.done` (count), and `tool.call.success` or `tool.call.retry`.

## Next actions (what I'd do next / handoff list)

1. (High) Run the local end-to-end test in your environment and confirm that tool calls with names like `functions.echo` resolve and return successful POST responses. If you see `Unknown tool:` or `Tool ... returned error`, paste the log lines here.
2. Add a small integration test that programmatically creates an n8n workflow with a webhook, activates it, and asserts the proxy can discover and invoke it.
3. Add a `DISCOVERY_ENABLED` toggle and consider keeping `TOOL_REGISTRY_JSON` as an optional override (documented) for edge cases.
4. Add automated unit tests for `N8nDiscovery` mapping/tokenization logic.
5. If desired, remove leftover `TOOL_REGISTRY_JSON` references in `docker-compose.yml` or clearly document that it is an optional fallback.

## Files changed

- proxy_server/n8n_discovery.py — new discovery helper (async)
- proxy_server/tool_handler.py — discovery integration and retry-on-404
- docker-compose.yml — ensure `N8N_API_KEY` is passed to `github-models-proxy`
- .env — `TOOL_REGISTRY_JSON` removed per instruction

## Notes

- I fixed the indentation issue that caused `get()` to be nested incorrectly and verified the modified files have no syntax errors found by static checks.
- I could not run Docker or the test client from this environment; please run the reproduction steps above locally and share logs if anything fails — I'll iterate further.
